# React tic-tac-toe tutorial - modernized
Took the tic-tac-toe tutorial from https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html and implemented it using Typescript and React hooks.
I primarily used https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/ as a guide for most of this.
Using hooks simplified the code quite a bit, and I finally figured out how to write properly typed typescript functions for passing props.
Figuring out how to replace classes with functional components was also kind of weird, but I figured out how to do that with some googling as well.
Just nest the functions!

Setting up a React project with Webpack, Typescript, React, and whatever else I might need/want (eslint? What else?) seemed like quite the ordeal in and of itself, and I just
want to code. But at the same time, I don't want to use create react app. So I used https://github.com/carlrip/react-typescript-eslint-webpack as a starting point. 

This github repo exists purely to remind me "how to do things with Typescript and React the proper way", at least from what I've read and seen.
